        <h4>Q. I couldn't download McIDAS-V. Is the server down?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Usually an inability to download McIDAS-V
        and other Unidata software is due to a failure by your system to correctly
        identify itself to our server.
        <p> Both our server and the system trying to download Unidata software
          have a &quot;name&quot; (domain name or host name or server name) and an IP address.
          For example the address 128.117.140.62 is the same as the server with
          name unidata.ucar.edu.</p>
        <p> As a security measure many servers only reply to requests from systems
          whose address can be matched to a name using &quot;reverse lookup&quot; - turning
          the numbers into a name.</p>
        <p> &quot;Forward lookups&quot; find the IP address of any given host name. The
          reverse action is resolving IP addresses into host names. If our server
          cannot resolve the requesting system IP address into a name, no software
          will be sent to the requesting IP address. If you are having problems
          downloading McIDAS-V from our server, check with your local system
          administrator to make sure that your machine has reverse lookup enabled.
          If not, download McIDAS-V from a system that does.</p>

      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When starting McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        the latest version of all McIDAS-V code is found at the UW-SSEC server,
        and it is automatically downloaded and installed if it is newer than
        the version you have on your system. </div>

      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Sometimes starting a program on a Windows
        system with Web Start will produce a dialog box that says &quot;There is no
        disk in drive A.&quot; Normally clicking the continue button will cause the

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How do I use the Web Start Applications Manager?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> If you run McIDAS-V from Web Start, for
        more control of McIDAS-V, use the Web Start Application Manager. You
        can launch it by clicking <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp"> here</a>.
        Alternatively, go to http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html,
        and find the Web Start &quot;Application Manager&quot; on that page. Start the &quot;Application
        Manager&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Launch&quot; button.
        <p> In the Application Manager you will see McIDAS-V, if you do this
          after you have installed McIDAS-V with Web Start.</p>
        <p> You can use the Application Manager to start McIDAS-V without going
          to the Unidata web page Web Start link, and to remove an old McIDAS-V
          to force a complete new McIDAS-V download next time you start McIDAS-V
          with the Unidata web page http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/metapps/webstart/IDV/
          .</p>
        <p> If your Web Start McIDAS-V installation seems broken, remove it with
          the Application Manager and reload from the McIDAS-V Web Start Link.
          When you run the Application Manager it will have a panel showing &quot;McIDAS-V&quot; 
          with an icon. Click to select and it will highlight; it
          may already be selected. Use the <code class="menu">Application-&gt;Remove
          Application</code> menu. The McIDAS-V item will go away. Reload McIDAS-V
          from the Unidata web site.</p>
        <p> You can see what Java version McIDAS-V is using. Use the Application
          Manager's <code class="menu">File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java</code> menu
          and look at &quot;Product version&quot;. </p>

        <h4>Q. How can I show the Java console when running with Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When you start McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        you don't have a console window opened by default. You can enable the
        Java console through the Web Start Applications Manager. Bring up the
        Web Start Manager (Java Application Cache Viewer) as described <a href="#wsmanager">above</a>.
        Use the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Preferences</code> menu to bring
        up the Preferences dialog. Click on the Advanced Tab and expand the Java
        Console item in the tree. Select the &quot;Show Console&quot; option and then click
        the OK button. The next time you start McIDAS-V with Web Start, you will
        get a console that will log messages. Messages are also logged to the
        McIDAS-V console. See the item <a href="#console">below</a> for information
        on using this feature. </div>

        <h4>Q. Can I serve up JNLP bundles from my own web server?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> You can save a bundle as a JNLP file
        by using a .jnlp extension in the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As...</code> menu
        dialog. Once you have the file, you can place it on your web server and
        create a web page that points to it. Your web server must identify this
        as a JNLP file, so if it doesn't already support this, you'll need to
        configure your Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file extension
        are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type. Each Web server
        has a specific way in which to add MIME types. For example, for the Apache
        Web server you must add the following line to the .mime.types configuration
        file:
        <pre>
application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
</pre>
        Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server. </div>

        <h4><strong>Q.</strong> Why do I see 'Local servers cannot write to userpath:' errors when starting McIDAS-V?</h4>
      </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>A.</strong> To use local servers in McIDAS-V, there is a background server listening process called <em>mcservl</em>. This process run for the duration of the session, and after McIDAS-V is exited, the process take extra time to terminate. If McIDAS-V is closed and started again before the <em>mcservl</em> process terminates, local servers will not be able to start and the 'Local servers cannot write to userpath:' error occurs. Once this error comes up, click OK. If you attempt connecting to a local dataset, a message will pop up directing you to the ADDE Data Manager, where navigating to the <em><strong>Local Servers -&gt; Start Local Servers</strong></em> menu item will start up the local servers correctly so that local servers can be used in the session. To avoid this error, it is recommended that a user waits about 10 seconds after exiting McIDAS-V before starting again.</p>
          <p>Additionally, if running 64bit Debian or Ubuntu operating systems, this message can appear at startup if the ia32-libs package is not installed on the workstation. The ia32-libs are the 32bit libraries that 32bit applications need to execute on a 64bit system.</p>

    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>A. </strong>GLX is an extension that must be supported by the graphics card.  This
      error is most likely occurring because the graphics drivers for RHEL are
      not properly configured.
      <p>Assuming that the latest graphics drivers are installed, they must be
      configured in the window system configuration file. Since RHEL uses Xorg,
      look in the file</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>                /etc/X11/xorg.conf

    <div class="faq-answer">
    <p><strong>A. </strong>If you have a firewall and are trying to get data from the remote servers
      (image, radar, point, and upper air data), error messages such
      as <span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>Error opening connection ... Operation

      Data Available<span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span> are normal.  For
      these servers to send data, your firewall software must allow connections
    on ports 112 (ADDE) and 8080 (THREDDS Data Server).</p></div>

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. Why am I having drawing problems on Monitor2 of a two-monitor system?</h4></div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>A.</strong> Some graphics card/driver combinations don't allow McIDAS-V window functions to work correctly in Monitor2 of two-monitor systems. For example, if your system has this problem and you move the McIDAS-V windows to Monitor2, the Image Chooser's Advanced tab in the Field Selector may not be visible, or adding a new tab in the Main Display may result in most of the window going blank ("graying out").  You may also receive the error (or see it in the mcidasv.log file), '<em>...adding a container to a container on a different GraphicsDevice</em>'.</p>
        <p>For now, the only working solution for this problem is to move the McIDAS-V windows to Monitor1. After doing this, the windows should display correctly and you should be able to successfully add new tabs and run bundles. </p>
        <p>If you are running Red Hat with a NVIDIA graphics card using TwinView and are having problems, go to the preferences, click on the primary display, and make sure the "Make this the primary display..." checkbox is checked. </p>

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. Why is there no map drawn in the McIDAS-V Main Display window?</h4></div>
<div class="faq-answer">
    <p><strong>A.</strong> Try changing your memory to use 1 GB or lower and restart McIDAS-V. You
        can change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V by editing the <strong>Maximum
        Heap Size</strong> in the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html">Advanced</a></strong> tab of the Preferences
        by selected <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences...</strong> from the Main Display window.</p>

    <a name="maplines" id="maplines"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How do I fix the spurious or missing map lines in my Main Display window?</h4></div>
<div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> If you run into this problem, you should first try changing your <strong><a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html#geobyref">Enable access to geometry by reference</a></strong> VisAD setting in the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab of the User Preferences window.&nbsp;You can get to the User&nbsp;Preferences window through the <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences</strong> menu item in the Main Display window. This option is turned on by default, but turning this option off can help to remove random/extraneous map lines that sometimes appear in the display. This is a problem that may occur more frequently on systems with ATI graphics cards. After changing this preference, click <strong>OK</strong> and restart McIDAS-V (any changes to the Advanced Preference require a restart to take affect).</p>
    <p>If this did not solve the map line problem, look in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong> tab of the Data Explorer for the <a href="controls/MapDisplayControl.html">Default Background Maps</a>. Determine which map is causing the spurious lines by toggling the visibility of the maps on and off. Once you determine which map is causing the lines, change the <strong>Fast Rendering</strong> option for this map.</p>
    <p>If there are no map lines visible in the <strong>Main Display</strong>, disabling geometry by reference and restarting the session may add map lines to the display.</p>
</div>
    <a name="blank" id="blank"></a>
     <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. Why do my images display blank (black or white) when there should be valid data?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>A.</strong> The first thing to do is to make sure that your graphics drivers are up to date. If this does not solve the problem, another option is to change the amount of memory allocated to McIDAS-V. From the Main Display window's menu bar, select <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences</strong>. This opens a User Preferences window, where you want to select the <a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html"><strong>Advanced</strong></a> tab. At the top of the window there are two options for selecting memory. Click the radio button that allows you to specify the numerical value of memory allocated to McIDAS-V. Enter in a value of 512 megabytes and click OK to save the change. Then exit and restart McIDAS-V (changes in the Advanced User Preferences require a restart of McIDAS-V to take effect). If this resolves the issue of white images, you can start increasing the memory until the problem appears again. Stay below the memory value that produces the problem.</p>
        <p>We have also received reports of this problem (blank images in the Main Display window) occurring on computers with the Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Family of graphics cards. If you have a computer with that configuration and are seeing the problem, try setting the card's "Vertex Processing" configuration setting to "Enable Software Processing". That setting is recommended because it will likely work with a typical amount of memory allocated to McIDAS-V (e.g., 80% of available). If the "Vertex Processing" option is set to a different value (e.g., "Application Settings" and "Default settings"), you may have to select a memory value of 800 MB or less in order to avoid the problem.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>A.</strong> When starting McIDAS-V on a 64-bit Windows machine, you may see this error message as the last line of your mcidasv.log file: &quot;Canvas3D: Non-recoverable graphics configuration error&quot;. If you run into this problem, you should first try updating your drivers and installing McIDAS-V again. If this does not solve the problem, it is possible that there are some graphics cards that do not have 64-bit drivers and thus will not be able to support the 64-bit installers. If this is the case for you, attempt to download McIDAS-V utilizing the 32-bit Windows installer instead of the 64-bit installer.</p>
        <p>Users can also follow the steps outlined in the <a href="UsingMcVFaq.html#basicchecks">What do I do if McIDAS-V will not work on my computer?</a> question of the Using McIDAS FAQ.  McIDAS User Services received a report that a user was able to resolve this error by uninstalling NVIDIA PhysX package and then reinstalling McIDAS-V.</p>
