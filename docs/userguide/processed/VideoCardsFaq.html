        <h4>Q. I couldn't download McIDAS-V. Is the server down?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Usually an inability to download McIDAS-V
        and other Unidata software is due to a failure by your system to correctly
        identify itself to our server.
        <p> Both our server and the system trying to download Unidata software
          have a &quot;name&quot; (domain name or host name or server name) and an IP address.
          For example the address 128.117.140.62 is the same as the server with
          name unidata.ucar.edu.</p>
        <p> As a security measure many servers only reply to requests from systems
          whose address can be matched to a name using &quot;reverse lookup&quot; - turning
          the numbers into a name.</p>
        <p> &quot;Forward lookups&quot; find the IP address of any given host name. The
          reverse action is resolving IP addresses into host names. If our server
          cannot resolve the requesting system IP address into a name, no software
          will be sent to the requesting IP address. If you are having problems
          downloading McIDAS-V from our server, check with your local system
          administrator to make sure that your machine has reverse lookup enabled.
          If not, download McIDAS-V from a system that does.</p>

        <h4>Q. How can I get updates through Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When starting McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        the latest version of all McIDAS-V code is found at the UW-SSEC server,
        and it is automatically downloaded and installed if it is newer than
        the version you have on your system. </div>

      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Sometimes starting a program on a Windows
        system with Web Start will produce a dialog box that says &quot;There is no
        disk in drive A.&quot; Normally clicking the continue button will cause the
        program to start properly. </div>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How do I use the Web Start Applications Manager?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> If you run McIDAS-V from Web Start, for
        more control of McIDAS-V, use the Web Start Application Manager. You
        can launch it by clicking <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp"> here</a>.
        Alternatively, go to http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html,
        and find the Web Start &quot;Application Manager&quot; on that page. Start the &quot;Application
        Manager&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Launch&quot; button.
        <p> In the Application Manager you will see McIDAS-V, if you do this
          after you have installed McIDAS-V with Web Start.</p>
        <p> You can use the Application Manager to start McIDAS-V without going
          to the Unidata web page Web Start link, and to remove an old McIDAS-V
          to force a complete new McIDAS-V download next time you start McIDAS-V
          with the Unidata web page http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/metapps/webstart/IDV/
          .</p>
        <p> If your Web Start McIDAS-V installation seems broken, remove it with
          the Application Manager and reload from the McIDAS-V Web Start Link.
          When you run the Application Manager it will have a panel showing &quot;McIDAS-V&quot; 
          with an icon. Click to select and it will highlight; it
          may already be selected. Use the <code class="menu">Application-&gt;Remove
          Application</code> menu. The McIDAS-V item will go away. Reload McIDAS-V
          from the Unidata web site.</p>
        <p> You can see what Java version McIDAS-V is using. Use the Application
          Manager's <code class="menu">File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java</code> menu
          and look at &quot;Product version&quot;. </p>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How can I show the Java console when running with Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When you start McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        you don't have a console window opened by default. You can enable the
        Java console through the Web Start Applications Manager. Bring up the
        Web Start Manager (Java Application Cache Viewer) as described <a href="#wsmanager">above</a>.
        Use the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Preferences</code> menu to bring
        up the Preferences dialog. Click on the Advanced Tab and expand the Java
        Console item in the tree. Select the &quot;Show Console&quot; option and then click
        the OK button. The next time you start McIDAS-V with Web Start, you will
        get a console that will log messages. Messages are also logged to the
        McIDAS-V console. See the item <a href="#console">below</a> for information
        on using this feature. </div>

        <h4>Q. Can I serve up JNLP bundles from my own web server?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> You can save a bundle as a JNLP file
        by using a .jnlp extension in the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As...</code> menu
        dialog. Once you have the file, you can place it on your web server and
        create a web page that points to it. Your web server must identify this
        as a JNLP file, so if it doesn't already support this, you'll need to
        configure your Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file extension
        are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type. Each Web server
        has a specific way in which to add MIME types. For example, for the Apache
        Web server you must add the following line to the .mime.types configuration
        file:
        <pre>
application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
</pre>
        Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server. </div>

      <h4>Q. Do I need a special video card to run McIDAS-V?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> Your graphics system must support
      3D; make sure you have the latest video driver for your graphics card.
      This is included in the Windows operating system. On Linux the driver must
      support GLX, an X windows system extension to OpenGL programs. See <a href="Systems.html#os">Operating
      System Requirements</a> for more information.</div>

      <h4>Q. Why does the display go gray or get corrupted when I resize my McIDAS-V
        display?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> ATI cards do not always work
      correctly with the OpenGL version of Java 3D under Windows. If you experience
      problems with corrupted displays (sets of triangles, spurious lines, weird
      looking displays) and have an ATI card and are running Windows, try the
      following:
      <ul>
        <li>Right click on the Windows Desktop and select Properties from the
          pop-up menu.</li>
        <li>From the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, make sure the color quality is 16 bit.</li>
        <li>Click the Advanced button and select the <strong>OpenGL</strong> tab. Depending on
          your card, either click the button for Force 16 bit buffer (or something
          like that) or click on the Compatibility settings button and click
          the <span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span>Force 16 bit<span class="faq-answer">&quot;</span> radio
          button.</li>
        <li>Click the OK buttons to exit the Display Properties dialog.</li>
        <li>Try McIDAS-V again and see if it works better.</li>
        <li>If not, try using the Direct-X installer instead of the OpenGL installer.</li></ul></div>

      <h4>Q. If I'm having problems with the OpenGL version under Windows, can
        I run the Direct-X version Java 3D?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> If you are using the version
      of Java 3D distributed with McIDAS-V (1.6.0), you can switch between the
      OpenGL and Direct-X versions of Java 3D with a command line switch. If
      you are using runMcV.bat to start McIDAS-V, edit that file and uncomment
      the appropriate line. If you have your own script for starting McIDAS-V,
      add in the <strong>-Dj3d.rend=d3d</strong> option to your start line (before
      -jar or class name).</div>

    <!--<a name="stereo" id="stereo"></a>
<div class="faq-question">
<h4>Q. Does McIDAS-V support 3D Stereo?</h4>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> The Java 3D library which McIDAS-V
  uses supports stereo on properly configured stereo devices. We have added the
  necessary code to allow stereo to work in certain configurations. At present,
  we do not have access to a stereo system like a GeoWall, so our experience
  testing with these systems is limited. You will need to modify the runMcV script
  to change the <strong>-Didv.enableStereo=false</strong> to be <strong>-Didv.enableStereo=true</strong> before
  starting McIDAS-V. If your runMcV script does not have the <strong>-Didv.enableStereo=false</strong> argument
  in it then change:
<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre>
to:
<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -Didv.enableStereo=true -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre>
<p>After doing this, if you bring up McIDAS-V on a stereo device and it does not appear to be in stereo, use the <a href="ui/Navigation.html#viewpoint">Viewpoint Toolbar</a> to set the display to a perspective view.</p>
</div>

<a name="one-eye" id="one-eye"></a>
<div class="faq-question">
<h4>Q. Why does my stereo display seem to use only one eye of the glasses?</h4>
</div>
<div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> Some stereo cards do not keep a separate Z-buffer per eye. If you are experiencing problems, try changing the line in the runMcV script to:
<pre>
command="java -Xmx512m -Didv.enableStereo=true -Dj3d.sharedstereozbuffer=true -jar idv.jar $*"
</pre></div>-->
