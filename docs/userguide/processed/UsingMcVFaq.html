        <h4>Q. I couldn't download McIDAS-V. Is the server down?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Usually an inability to download McIDAS-V
        and other Unidata software is due to a failure by your system to correctly
        identify itself to our server.
        <p> Both our server and the system trying to download Unidata software
          have a &quot;name&quot; (domain name or host name or server name) and an IP address.
          For example the address 128.117.140.62 is the same as the server with
          name unidata.ucar.edu.</p>
        <p> As a security measure many servers only reply to requests from systems
          whose address can be matched to a name using &quot;reverse lookup&quot; - turning
          the numbers into a name.</p>
        <p> &quot;Forward lookups&quot; find the IP address of any given host name. The
          reverse action is resolving IP addresses into host names. If our server
          cannot resolve the requesting system IP address into a name, no software
          will be sent to the requesting IP address. If you are having problems
          downloading McIDAS-V from our server, check with your local system
          administrator to make sure that your machine has reverse lookup enabled.
          If not, download McIDAS-V from a system that does.</p>

        <h4>Q. How can I get updates through Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When starting McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        the latest version of all McIDAS-V code is found at the UW-SSEC server,
        and it is automatically downloaded and installed if it is newer than
        the version you have on your system. </div>

      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> Sometimes starting a program on a Windows
        system with Web Start will produce a dialog box that says &quot;There is no
        disk in drive A.&quot; Normally clicking the continue button will cause the
        program to start properly. </div>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How do I use the Web Start Applications Manager?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> If you run McIDAS-V from Web Start, for
        more control of McIDAS-V, use the Web Start Application Manager. You
        can launch it by clicking <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/webstart/IDV/player.jnlp"> here</a>.
        Alternatively, go to http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/demos.html,
        and find the Web Start &quot;Application Manager&quot; on that page. Start the &quot;Application
        Manager&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Launch&quot; button.
        <p> In the Application Manager you will see McIDAS-V, if you do this
          after you have installed McIDAS-V with Web Start.</p>
        <p> You can use the Application Manager to start McIDAS-V without going
          to the Unidata web page Web Start link, and to remove an old McIDAS-V
          to force a complete new McIDAS-V download next time you start McIDAS-V
          with the Unidata web page http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/metapps/webstart/IDV/
          .</p>
        <p> If your Web Start McIDAS-V installation seems broken, remove it with
          the Application Manager and reload from the McIDAS-V Web Start Link.
          When you run the Application Manager it will have a panel showing &quot;McIDAS-V&quot; 
          with an icon. Click to select and it will highlight; it
          may already be selected. Use the <code class="menu">Application-&gt;Remove
          Application</code> menu. The McIDAS-V item will go away. Reload McIDAS-V
          from the Unidata web site.</p>
        <p> You can see what Java version McIDAS-V is using. Use the Application
          Manager's <code class="menu">File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java</code> menu
          and look at &quot;Product version&quot;. </p>

      <div class="faq-question">
        <h4>Q. How can I show the Java console when running with Web Start?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> When you start McIDAS-V using Web Start,
        you don't have a console window opened by default. You can enable the
        Java console through the Web Start Applications Manager. Bring up the
        Web Start Manager (Java Application Cache Viewer) as described <a href="#wsmanager">above</a>.
        Use the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Preferences</code> menu to bring
        up the Preferences dialog. Click on the Advanced Tab and expand the Java
        Console item in the tree. Select the &quot;Show Console&quot; option and then click
        the OK button. The next time you start McIDAS-V with Web Start, you will
        get a console that will log messages. Messages are also logged to the
        McIDAS-V console. See the item <a href="#console">below</a> for information
        on using this feature. </div>

        <h4>Q. Can I serve up JNLP bundles from my own web server?</h4>
      </div>
      </a>
      <div class="faq-answer"><b>A.</b> You can save a bundle as a JNLP file
        by using a .jnlp extension in the <code class="menu">File-&gt;Save As...</code> menu
        dialog. Once you have the file, you can place it on your web server and
        create a web page that points to it. Your web server must identify this
        as a JNLP file, so if it doesn't already support this, you'll need to
        configure your Web server so that all files with the .jnlp file extension
        are set to the application/x-java-jnlp-file MIME type. Each Web server
        has a specific way in which to add MIME types. For example, for the Apache
        Web server you must add the following line to the .mime.types configuration
        file:
        <pre>
application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP
</pre>
        Check the documentation for the specifics of your Web server. </div>

      <h4>Q. What do I do if McIDAS-V will not work on my computer?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <strong>A.</strong> Listed below is a basic checklist of steps to follow if your McIDAS-V
        is not working properly. Once you successfully complete each step in
        the process, restart McIDAS-V and try again. If the problem still exists,
        proceed to the next step, and so on.
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure that your <strong><em>drivers</em></strong> are up to date.
          Please see the <strong>Graphics Cards and Drivers</strong> section of the <a href="Systems.html#video">System
          Requirements</a> page for more information.</li>
        <li>Try the j3dtest script to verify that you can view the spinning cube. Please see the <strong>Java Versions</strong> section of the <a href="Systems.html#java">System Requirements</a> page for more information. If this example does not work, then your system does not support Java3D. Instructions for running this test differ between operating systems:<br />
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>Linux and macOS -</strong> cd to the directory where McIDAS-V was installed (likely the McIDAS-V-System directory) and run: <strong>./j3dtest</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Windows -</strong> From the Start menu, </strong>navigate through Programs to find the directory containing the McIDAS-V scripts. This directory is defined during the installation of McIDAS-V. Select the <strong>Java3D Test</strong> script.  Alternatively, through a Command Prompt window, cd to the directory where McIDAS-V was installed (likely the McIDAS-V-System directory) and run: <strong>j3dtest.bat</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
Note: If your system does not support Java3D version 1.3.1+ McIDAS-V will not work for you.</li>
        <li> Set a small heap size by setting the <em><strong>Memory</strong></em> option to 512 megabytes in the User Preferences window's <a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html"><strong>Advanced</strong></a> tab. If this resolves the issue, you can start increasing the   memory until the problem appears again. Stay below the memory value   that produces the problem.</li>
        <li>Disable Java Access to Image Data by Reference by unchecking <strong><em>Enable access to image data by reference</em></strong> option in the User Preferences window's <a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html"><strong> Advanced</strong></a> tab.</li>
        <li>Rename your <a href="#filelocations"><strong>McIDAS-V</strong></a> document directory to start with a clean set of options. This will undo the changes made in steps 3-4 listed above, but it will eliminate any corrupt startup bundles or settings.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 3-4 with a clean slate.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. Where are the McIDAS-V files stored on my computer?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> McIDAS-V files are divided into two categories: &quot;system files&quot; (supplied files that should not be edited) in the <strong>McIDAS-V-System</strong> directory and &quot;user files&quot; (new user-created files and supplied ones that contain user settings and preferences) that are in the <strong>McIDAS-V</strong> directory. The files in <strong>McIDAS-V-System</strong> are specific to the version of McIDAS-V. The files in <strong>McIDAS-V</strong> are not dependent on McIDAS-V version (such as XML files containing color enhancements, formulas, projections, etc.), so these settings will be carried from version to version. The system file directory can be changed during installation and its location defaults to the OS application directory (e.g., <strong>C:\Program Files</strong> on Windows, <strong>/Applications</strong> on OS X/macOS). The user file directory is created in the user's document directory (e.g., <strong>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>user</em></strong>\ or <strong>C:\Users\<em>user</em>\</strong> on Windows, <strong>/Users/<em>user</em>/Documents</strong> on  OS X/macOS, <strong>/home/<em>user</em></strong> on Linux). Files in these directories should not be edited by the user, but rather contact the <a href="../../../support/" target="_blank">McIDAS Help Desk</a> or post to the <a href="https://mcidas.ssec.wisc.edu/forums/" target="_blank">McIDAS-V Support Forums</a> for assistance if it is necessary to edit them.</div>
    <a name="busy" id="busy"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I tell if McIDAS-V is busy doing something?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> The lower right corner of the Main Display window shows a box with progress bars if McIDAS-V is busy making a display or doing anything. In the status bar at the bottom, messages will appear when McIDAS-V is reading data from a server or disk. Also, while the displays are being created, there is usually a &quot;please wait&quot; notice in the lower left corner of the main display. When McIDAS-V is in the middle of a process in the Data Explorer window, the cursor will change to a spinning, blue ring.</div>
    <a name="savedisplay" id="savedisplay"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I save a display?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> McIDAS-V supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF image formats. McIDAS-V can also write out an image and the corresponding Google Earth KML or KMZ files. Animations can be captured as QuickTime movies or animated GIFs. See <a href="display_controls/ImageCaptures.html">Image Captures</a> for more information. You can save a particular McIDAS-V state with all displays, data sources, maps, etc. by saving the data as a <a href="Bundles.html">bundle</a>. You can also save a bundle as a favorite.</div>
    <a name="changestart" id="changestart"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I change the start-up settings?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><strong>A.</strong> You can customize many of the  McIDAS-V properties through the User Preferences window, accessed through the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/Preferences.html">Edit-&gt;Preferences</a></strong> menu item in the Main Display window. This allows you to configure the many features of McIDAS-V.
</p>
        <p>You can set a bundle to open by default when you start McIDAS-V. To do this, save a bundle as a <a href="Bundles.html#favorites">favorite</a> and set it as your default bundle in the Defaults panel of the <a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html"><strong>Advanced</strong></a> tab of the User Preferences window.</p>
        <p>You can also&nbsp;set the locations of the Main Display window and the Data Explorer window, as well as the number of tabs and panels. To do this, save a <a href="ui/Menus.html#defaultlayout">default layout</a> via the <strong>File-&gt;Default Layout</strong> menu item in the Main Display window.</p>
    </div>
    <a name="memory" id="memory"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I change the amount of memory available to McIDAS-V?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong>  You can change the amount of memory used by McIDAS-V by editing the <strong>Memory</strong> in the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html">Advanced</a></strong> tab of the User Preferences window by selecting <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences...</strong> from the Main Display window. See <a href="Starting.html#run">Running McIDAS-V</a> for more information.</div>
    <a name="projections" id="projections"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I reset the map projections?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> This can be controlled with the <strong>Projections-&gt;<a href="ui/DisplayMenus.html#autosetpro">Auto-set Projection</a></strong> menu check-box. You can switch an existing display to its native data set projection using the display control's <strong>View-&gt;Use Data Projection</strong> menu.</div>
    <a name="defaultprojection" id="defaultprojection"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I set the default projection?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> The default projection is set with the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/DisplayWindowPreferences.html#defaultprojection">Default Projection</a></strong> field in the <strong>Display Window</strong> tab of the User Preferences window.&nbsp;This window is accessed via the <strong>Edit-&gt;Preferences</strong> menu item in the Main Display. If you do not want to use any of the native projections of McIDAS-V, you can create your own projections with the <a href="tools/ProjectionManager.html">Projection Manager</a> which is accessed from the <strong>Projections-&gt;New/Edit</strong> menu item in the Main Display window. The default projection is overridden by the projection saved in the default bundle, or by displaying new data, if the <strong>Projections-&gt;<a href="ui/DisplayMenus.html#autosetpro">Auto-Set Projection</a></strong> menu checkbox is checked on. As a result, you may never see the default map projection unless your default bundle has the default projection, and you have the checkbox checked off. Choosing a default map projection is not necessary to use of McIDAS-V, it is just a feature to allow for further user-customization of their sessions.</div>
    <a name="colorrange" id="colorrange"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How can I change the color table range of a displayed parameter?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> You can change the range for a display parameter in the <a href="tools/ColorTableEditor.html">Color Table Editor</a>. This can be accessed in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong> tab of the Data Explorer by clicking the button next to Color Table, or by right-clicking on the color bar in the Legend of the Main Display window and selecting <strong>Edit Color Table</strong>. The range of the color table can be changed next to the  <a href="tools/ColorTableEditor.html#range">Range button</a> in the Color Table Editor. Alternatively, you can change the range outside of the Color Table Editor by right clicking on the color bar in the Legend of the Main Display window and selecting <strong>Change Range...</strong>, which opens a Change Range window where you can enter new values. If you always want to use a specific data range for a parameter, you can create a user parameter default so the range you desire will always be used when displaying the parameter. This can be done through the <strong>Tools-&gt;Parameters-&gt;Defaults</strong> menu item in the Main Display window to get to the <a href="tools/ParameterDefaultsEditor.html">Parameter Defaults Editor</a>.</div>
    <a name="transparency" id="transparency"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. When I set a color table transparent, why doesn't it show up that
        way?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> Using transparency in a color display may give unexpected results. In general, only the last thing added can be fully transparent. If you have a display that is transparent, then add in a new display, you may not see it.  You can use the display control's <strong>View-&gt;<a href="controls/LayerControls.html#bringtofront">Bring to Front</a></strong> menu to remove and re-add the display that you want to be transparent so it is last.</div>
    <a name="fewercolors" id="fewercolors"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. When I load an image, why is it displayed with fewer colors than I expect?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> First, check that your display
      configuration is set to the maximum number of colors (e.g., 32 bit) so
      that McIDAS-V is able to display imagery and color tables using a full
      range of colors. If that is set correctly, it's possible that the range
      of values defined for the color table is less than the range of values
      in the displayed image. You can view or modify the range of values defined
      for the color table by right-clicking on the color bar in the Legend of
      the Main Display window and selecting either <strong>Change Range...</strong> or <strong>Edit
      Color Table</strong>. Right-clicking also displays other options that let
      you apply a different color table or edit the current one. If you created a contour display, you may also need to lower the Contour Interval in the <a href="controls/misc/ContourDialog.html">Contour Properties Editor</a>.</div>
    <a name="blocky" id="blocky"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. When I load an image, why does it appear pixelated (blocky)?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p><strong>A.</strong> A displayed image can appear pixelated (blocky)
        due to one or more factors, including the resolution of the displayed
        image, the magnification and pixel sampling factors at which it
        was displayed, and the zoom factor.</p>
      <p> For example, if you display an 8 km resolution image while zoomed in
        to a small geographic region such that each display pixel represents
        a higher resolution value (e.g., 1 km<sup>2</sup>
	   of the earth surface) the image pixels need to be
		duplicated to fill the display and thus the image will appear pixelated.
		The same effect will occur with any image if you zoom in (using the
		<a href="ui/Navigation.html#navigation">Zoom/Pan Toolbar</a> buttons or <a href="ui/Navigation.html">other
		zooming actions</a>) to where the display
		resolution is higher than the image resolution.</p>
      <p> If you believe that the displayed image is more pixelated than it should
          be for its given resolution, check the settings of the <a href="data/DataSubset.html#mag">Magnification
          sliders</a> in the <strong>Field Selector's</strong> <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and the <a href="controls/ImagePlanViewControl.html#psample">Pixel
          Sampling slider</a> in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong> tab. In order to display the
          image at the highest possible resolution (its native resolution),
          the line and element magnifications must be set to 1 (sliders all the
          way to the right) and the pixel sampling set to 0 (slider all the way
          to the left).</p>
    </div>	  
    <a name="maps" id="maps"></a>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h4>Q. How do I change which maps are displayed by default?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer"><strong>A.</strong> By default, there are three maps that are displayed: 'North &amp; Central America', 'World Political Boundaries', and 'World Coastlines'. Other system maps are included with the <a href="controls/MapDisplayControl.html">Map Controls</a>, and their visibilities can be toggled on and off. Additional maps are contained in plugins that can be found under the Maps category in the <a href="tools/Plugins.html">Plugin Manager</a>. Users can add their own shapefile maps through the <strong>Edit -&gt; Add Your Own Map</strong> menu item in the <strong>Layer Controls</strong> of the Default Background Maps. To set a new group of maps as the default, use the <strong>File -&gt; Default Maps -&gt; Save as the Default Map Set</strong> menu item. This creates a maps.xml file in the McIDAS-V directory that includes which map layers are displayed, as well as different display settings including the line thickness, style, and color. Once the default map is saved, this will be used any time a new tab or window is created, and it will be persisted between sessions. To remove a default map setting that has been saved, use the <strong>File -&gt; Default Maps -&gt; Remove Local Map Defaults</strong> menu item. Removing the default map set requires a restart of McIDAS-V to take effect.</div>
