<div class="pagesubtitle">Where to find Help and Support for McIDAS-V</div>
If you are having problems installing or using McIDAS-V, or want to know how
to perform a particular task, you have several resources to assist you.
<ul class="childlist">
  <li><a href="#documentation">McIDAS-V Documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#support">Other Sources of Help </a></li>
</ul>
<div class="pagesubtitle"><a name="documentation" id="documentation"></a>McIDAS-V Documentation</div>
<p>The first source of support is this McIDAS-V User's Guide. It contains complete
  instructions for downloading, installing, running, and using the McIDAS-V reference
  application and all its features. It also has a <a href="Faq.html"> Frequently
  Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> section with answers to many of the most commonly
  asked questions. The
  User's Guide can be accessed from the McIDAS-V <strong>Help-&gt;User's
  Guide</strong> menu or online at <a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/mcv_guide/current/" target="_blank">https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/mcv_guide/current/</a>.
</p>
<p>Additional documentation is available on the McIDAS-V homepage (<a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/" target="_blank">https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/</a>),
  including McIDAS-V training materials (tutorials and
  data used in training sessions) and McIDAS-V source code.</p>
<!--There is also a gallery of examples displays created in McIDAS-V.-->
<div class="pagesubtitle"> <a name="support" id="support"></a>Other Sources of Help </div>
<p>If you have questions or encounter problems that the McIDAS-V documentation
  (described above) doesn't provide sufficient help, there are two additional
  sources of help. They are the McIDAS-V Support
  Forums and the McIDAS Help Desk. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://mcidas.ssec.wisc.edu/forums/" target="_blank">McIDAS-V Support Forums</a> contain
  subject-based forums, each
  with topics and posts relating to the forum's subject. Only registered users
  can post on the forums. However, anyone can view the forums and their contents
  (i.e., visit as an unregistered &quot;Guest&quot;).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../support/" target="_blank">McIDAS Help Desk</a> is
  staffed during business hours with user-support personnel. As noted in the
  <a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/mug/policydoc/" target="_blank">MUG Policy Document</a>, the help
  desk is supported by the fees paid by the <a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/mug/" target="_blank">McIDAS
  Users' Group (MUG)</a> and thus provides advanced-level support for MUG members.
  For McIDAS-V all users (whether or not a MUG member) are welcome to contact
  the help desk to report software bugs or suggest improvements (enhancements).</p>
<p>When reporting a bug, first check for related error
  messages in the <a href="misc/Console.html">Message
      Console</a>, and include the appropriate error messages in your email message.
      Also include as much information as you can about how you were running
      McIDAS-V and what happened, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the version of McIDAS-V that you are using (use the <strong>Help-&gt;About
      McIDAS-V</strong> menu)</li>
  <li>your operating system and version level</li>
  <li>any messages on the console (to see the console, use the <strong>Help-&gt;Show
        Console</strong> menu)</li>
  <li>exact data source and parameter choice</li>
  <li>types of display being made and in use</li>
  <li>the sequence of McIDAS-V actions and choices that caused the problem</li>
  <li>a <a href="Bundles.html">bundle file</a> that recreates the problem if
    the data sources are network accessible (optional, but desirable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Send this information to the McIDAS Help Desk using one of the three methods
below.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Fill out the support form available from the <strong>Help-&gt;Support
      Request Form</strong> menu. Please include as much information as possible
      about the problem. <em>(This is the preferred method.) </em></li>
  <li>Fill out the <a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/contact/?mcv" target="_blank">contact</a> form
    available on the McIDAS Website. Please include as much information as possible
    about the problem.</li>
