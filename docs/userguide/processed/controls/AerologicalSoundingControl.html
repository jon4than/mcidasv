<div class="pagesubtitle">Overview</div>
<p>The meteorological sounding display is available for:
RAOBs, 
numerical weather prediction model output, and from a local file that contains aircraft track data.
    The dewpoint temperature is computed by internal code from temperature and
    relative humidity grids.</p>
<p>To load sounding data see <a href="../quickstart/Sounding.html#connecting">Choosing
     RAOB Sounding Data</a> and <a href="../quickstart/Grids.html">Displaying
     Gridded Data</a>. The sounding display consists of a table of  aerological (thermodynamic)
    parameters and three tabs: <strong>Sounding Chart</strong>, <strong>Hodograph</strong>, and <strong>Table</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sounding Chart </strong> tab includes an aerological  diagram (e.g., skew-T,
  Stuve, Emagram):</p>

<span class="caption">Image 1: Skew-T of Point Data</span></div>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Properties</div>
<ul class="propertylist">
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Station</strong> - Selects which station's sounding is being displayed when multiple stations are selected in the Main Display window.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong><img src="images/AnimButtons.gif" width="243" height="32" alt="Time Animation Control"align="absmiddle"> Time Animation Control</strong> - Controls the looping of   displays through time.    See  <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/mcv_guide/working/ui/Animation.html">Time   Animation Control</a> for more information.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Dry Adiabats </strong> - Displays the dry adiabats on the Skew-T diagram.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Saturation Adiabats </strong> - Displays the saturation adiabats on the Skew-T diagram.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Mixing Ratio </strong> - Displays the mixing ratio lines on the Skew-T diagram.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Parcel Path</strong> - Displays the path of a parcel of air lifted pseudo-adiabatically
      from the initial point to the top of the Skew-T diagram.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Virtual Temperature</strong> - Displays the virtual temperatures of the environmental profile and
      pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Grid Points</strong> - Plots points in the Main Display window spatially separated by the resolution of the data. These grid points&nbsp;represent the actual locations of where the data values in the sounding are retrieved. The data probe may be between one of these grid points, but the display in the sounding will be indicative of the nearest grid point&nbsp;to the location of the probe.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Parcel mode</strong> - Specifies how  the initial conditions of the pseudo-adiabatically
      lifted air-parcel  are determined from
      the environmental sounding 
      according to the mode indicated. This will affect how the LNB, LFC, LCL, CAPE, and CIN are calculated. The choices are: </li>
	  <ul class="propertylist">
	    <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Bottom of Sounding</strong> - Determines the initial conditions of the
	      parcel from the temperature and dewpoint at the level of highest pressure. The path will  update whenever the profiles change.</li>
	    <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Below Cursor</strong> - Determines the initial conditions of the parcel
	       from the temperature and dewpoint profiles by computing
	      the pressure-weighted mean potential temperature and water vapor mixing-ratio
	      of the atmosphere that lies below the cursor when the middle mouse
	      button is pressed. Thus, pressing the middle button at 950 hPa for
	      a sounding that starts at 1000 hPa will effectively mix the lower 50
	      hPa of the atmosphere and lift the resulting parcel starting at 975
	      hPa. The path will  update whenever the profiles change and as the cursor is dragged.</li>
	    <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>At Cursor Pressure</strong> - Determines the initial pressure, in-situ
	      temperature, and moisture content of the parcel  from the
	      temperature and dewpoint profiles at the pressure of the cursor when
	      the middle mouse button is pressed. The initial moisture content is determined from
	      the dewpoint profile at the initial pressure. The path will update whenever the profiles change and as the cursor is dragged.</li>
	    <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>At Cursor (Press, Temp)</strong> - The computed path of a lifted
	      parcel is automatically updated when appropriate.  The initial pressure and in-situ temperature of the parcel equal the
	      pressure and temperature values under the cursor when the middle mouse
	      button is pressed. The path will update
        whenever the profiles change and as the cursor is dragged.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Wind spacing</strong> - Allows the user to control which wind levels are shown in the display.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Consecutive Profiles -</strong> Allows for plotting both the current sounding, as well as the sounding of the next time step in one image. The temperature and dewpoint temperature profiles of the current timestep will be dashed, and the profiles of the next timestep will be displayed as solid lines. The current time's winds will be displayed directly to the right of the sounding, and the next timestep's winds will be shown to the right of that. This makes it easy to see how a profile will change through time. This will reduce the number of time steps in the loop&nbsp;by 1.&nbsp;This option will not make any changes to the display if only have one&nbsp;timestep is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A label above the sounding's chart shows the station number, date, and time of the sounding. When displaying sounding plots made from gridded
  model output, the position of the sounding is shown in the Main Display window
  by a solid-color selector point and vertical line. The model-output-based
  sounding position over the map can be changed by dragging the selector point with the left
  mouse button.</p>
<p> When displaying a sounding diagram made from gridded numerical weather model
  output, there is a pull-down selector menu of the model output valid times
  in the upper right corner.</p>
<p> The <a href="../ui/Animation.html">animation control</a> buttons are available
  in either case:</p>
<div class="images"><img src="images/AnimButtons.gif" width="243" height="32" alt="Time Animation widget"></div>
<p>To increase precision using the sounding diagram, enlarge the window by dragging
  on the edges. Zoom in on the sounding diagram by holding down the Shift key
  and dragging the right button upwards; drag downwards to zoom out. Zooming can also be done by using the scroll wheel on the mouse. Pan the diagram by dragging the mouse pointer in any direction while holding down
the right mouse button.</p>
<p><a name="interactive" id="interactive"></a> The temperature and dewpoint traces can be modified via the cursor. Press
  the left button on the first data-point to be modified and drag it horizontally
  along an isobar to the desired position, then move the pointer diagonally along
  an isotherm to keep the data-point at the desired position and to pick-up the
  next data-point. Repeat until done and then release the mouse button.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hodograph</strong> tab shows a 3D hodograph display:</p>
<div class="images"><img  src="images/GridSkewTControlGui2.gif"  alt="Image 2: Hodograph of Point Data" ><br>
<span class="caption">Image 2: Hodograph of Point Data</span></div>
<p>The hodograph is enabled if the plotted data includes wind fields. It can
  be rotated into 3D by clicking and dragging the right mouse button. Zoom in/out by holding down Shift and <em>right-clicking</em> and dragging up/down or by using the scroll wheel on the mouse. To reset the
  hodograph, use Ctrl+R.</p>
<p>The <strong>Table</strong> tab shows a table of all values in the sounding:</p>
<div class="images"><img  src="images/GridSkewTControlGui4.gif"  alt="Image 3: Table of Point Data" ><br>
<span class="caption">Image 3: Table of Point Data</span></div>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Properties</div>
<ul class="propertylist">
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>Show U and V</strong> - Breaks the Speed and Direction categories up into the individual U and V components of the wind.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Aerological Parameters</div>
<p>The table to the left of the sounding diagram contains aerological parameters
determined from the atmospheric sounding displayed in the diagram. The following
abbreviations are used:</p>
<ul class="propertylist">
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>LCL: Lifting Condensation Level -</strong> The level at which a pseudo-adiabatically
    lifted air-parcel becomes saturated with water vapor.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>LFC: Level of Free Convection -</strong> The level at which the virtual temperature of
    a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel changes from being less than the
    environment's virtual temperature to being greater than the environment's virtual temperature.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>LNB: Level of Neutral Buoyancy -</strong> The level above the LFC at which the virtual
    temperature of a pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel equals the environment's
    virtual temperature.</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>CAPE: Convective Available Potential Energy -</strong> The area between the virtual temperature
    trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the virtual temperature
    trace of the environment from the LFC to the LNB in which the parcel's virtual
    temperature is greater than the environment's (positive CAPE connotes convective
    development).</li>
  <li class="propertylistitem"><strong>CIN: Convective Inhibition -</strong> The negative of the area between the virtual temperature
    trace of the pseudo-adiabatically lifted air-parcel and the virtual temperature
    trace of the environment from the parcel's initial conditions to the LFC
    in which the parcel's virtual temperature is less than the environment's
    (negative CIN connotes initial positive work to lift the parcel).</li>
</ul>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Menus</div>
<p>Many of the menu items seen utilizing this display are standard options that can be found in the <a href="LayerControls.html#menus">Menus section</a> of the Layer Controls page. However, there are some options that are unique to this display.</p>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu has this unique option:</p>
<ul class="propertylist">
