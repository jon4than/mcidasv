    <b>Welcome to McIDAS-V, the next generation in SSEC's 40 year history of sophisticated McIDAS software packages!</b><br><br>

    <font color="#FF0000">IMPORTANT NOTICE:</font> McIDAS-V utilizes the latest developments in Java 3D 
    programming and video driver updates. If you encounter any problems with 
    system instability (such as using all of the memory or CPU on your machine, 
    or frequent software crashes) or unusual data displays with &quot;torn&quot; 
    or &quot;gray&quot; images, you should make sure you have <b>the latest 
    video driver for your system</b>. Even if the system is brand new, the video
    driver may not be the most recent version available.<br><br>

    Please see the <a href="https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/download/sysreqs/">System Requirements for McIDAS-V</a> for 
    more information.<br><br>

    If you continue to have problems, contact the McIDAS Help Desk by submitting
    a bug report in the <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/forums/">McIDAS-V Support Forums</a>.
