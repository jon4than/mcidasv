/**
 * <p>McIDAS-V needs to manage ViewManagers in a slightly different way than 
 * the IDV. The key differences between the two are the way previously active 
 * ViewManagers are ordered and a (hopefully) more consistent way of handling 
 * active ViewManagers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The IDV only keeps track of the ViewManager used immediately before the 
 * current one. McV keeps track of the previously active ViewManagers in a 
 * stack. This mimics window z-ordering and always returns the user to the most
 * recently active ViewManager upon removal of the active ViewManager.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Newly created ViewManagers and their first layer now become the active
 * ViewManager and layer. If there is only one ViewManager, it is now displayed
 * as active instead of just implying it. When the active ViewManager is 
 * removed, the last active ViewManager and its first layer become active.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>A note to the future</b>: McV/IDV supports two notions of active and 
 * selected ViewManagers. Say you have NxN ViewManagers in a ComponentHolder, 
 * and you want to share views among some of these ViewManagers. When one of 
 * these shared ViewManagers is activated, should all of them become the active
 * ViewManager? We're going to have to work out how to convey which 
 * ViewManagers are shared and active, and maybe more? Good luck!</p>
